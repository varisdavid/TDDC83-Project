Except for concepts from scrum the development team is also working with a concept called pair programming taken from agile method eXtreme programming. 

\subsection{Pair programming}
Pair programming is an agile development method where two developers are to work at a shared work station. Due to distance mode at the time of this project being developed, the development team has worked around this by using the program Discord to be able to talk to their partner during the coding process. Using pair programming ensures that the programmers in the pair learns from each other and helps to develop each other's capabilities. One programmer writes the code, whereas the other programmer observes and comes with input. These roles are changed frequently in order to let both of the programmers in the pair write code.
