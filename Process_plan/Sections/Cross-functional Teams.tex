\subsection{Development}
The Development team is working a lot in cross-functional teams and is going to do so even more as the product comes in to the stages where testing is needed on a higher level. At this point cross-functional teams with testers and developers will be set up in order for the group to efficiently solve bugs. This far the development team has been working in cross-functional teams with the analysts when mapping the requirements to the product backlog. Emil Str√∂mberg is currently working with Gustav Karlsson in order to introduce tests in the CI/CD pipeline. When starting the development there was also meetings with the UX/design team to cover what has been working good and not so well when testing the prototypes.
