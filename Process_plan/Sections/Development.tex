What processes the development team are to use.
\subsection{Team work}
Much of how development is working is also covered in the SCRUM- and pair programming sections which is why these processes will not be covered in depth here. 
\subsection{Bugs}
Bugs are corrected directly by the developers if they find a bug while developing a feature. If bugs are found while running tests by the testers, a cross-funcional team is set up during a standup meeting where the development group is to assign the developers with the best knowledge regarding the feature to fix the bug together with a tester who can assure that the bug is fixed correctly. 
\subsection{Confusion in regards to issues}
If developers are confused by the SRS, Hi-Fi prototype or the product backlog this is gone through during a SCRUM-meeting when they talk to their team leader Filip Eriksson who has the knowledge about who to talk to in order to acquire the knowledge needed to resolve the problem. 
\subsection{Changes in the requirements}
If the development team notices something that needs to be included in the requirements, Filip Eriksson is to contact the analysis team in order to assure that this is included.
