In this section, processes regarding the development team are described. 
\subsection{Team work}
Much of how development is working is also covered in the SCRUM- and pair programming sections which is why these processes will not be covered in depth here. 
\subsection{Bugs}
Bugs are corrected directly by the developers if they find a bug while developing a feature. If bugs are found while running tests by the testers, a cross-funcional team is set up during a standup meeting where the development group is to assign the developers with the best knowledge regarding the feature to fix the bug together with a tester who can assure that the bug is fixed correctly. 
\subsection{Confusion in regards to issues}
If developers are confused by the SRS, Hi-Fi prototype or the product backlog this is gone through during a SCRUM-meeting when they talk to their team leader Filip Eriksson who has the knowledge about who to talk to in order to acquire the knowledge needed to resolve the problem. 
\subsection{Changes in the requirements}
If the development team notices something that needs to be included in the requirements, Filip Eriksson is to contact the analysis team in order to assure that this is included. 
\subsection{naming conventions for components} \label{Naming convention}

\subsection{eXtreme Programming}
Except for concepts from scrum the development team is also working with a concept called pair programming taken from agile method eXtreme programming. 
\subsubsection{Pair programming}
Pair programming is an agile development method where two developers are to work at a shared work station. Due to distance mode at the time of this project being developed, the development team has worked around this by using the program Discord to be able to talk to their partner during the coding process. Using pair programming ensures that the programmers in the pair learns from each other and helps to develop each other's capabilities. One programmer writes the code, whereas the other programmer observes and comes with input. These roles are changed frequently in order to let both of the programmers in the pair write code.
