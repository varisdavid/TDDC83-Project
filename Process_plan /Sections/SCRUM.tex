The project is divided into specific time frames called iterations. More on this topic and what is to be done during the different sprints can be found in the project plan. 

\subsection{Sprint planning}
Project manager Axel Trolme has together with the team leaders created a GANTT-chart of the different tasks that is to be performed in the specific sprints.

\subsection{Product Backlog}
Since the software requirements specification(SRS) is currently under update, so is also the product backlog for the project. The product backlog is a list of tasks used by the development team in order to achieve the goal product. These tasks shall be broken down into small parts that together makes up the web application. In the near future, the product backlog is going to cover how to implement all the requirements in the SRS and the items in the product backlog is also to map against a specific requirement from the SRS. The product backlog shall be listed as issues in GitLab where each developer can choose an issue that is reasonable to implement at that point in time. Each issue should be handpicked in consideration of what else is currently under implementation. The issues are also to be divided into groups based on importance. The developers are to mainly choose issues that are of a higher importance to the project.  

\subsection{Standups}
To get a better flow in the processes standups are to be used. The different groups are to do a standup in the beginning of every meeting, where each member of the team is to explain what they have done since the last meeting as well as what they are to do until the next meeting. The standups are supposed to ensure transparency in the groups as well as enhance the group's productivity. During the meetings, problems that have emerged during the passed week are discussed and help is given from the other members of the team. In short, the main topics discussed are: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item What did I work on yesterday?
    \item What am I working on today?
    \item What issues are blocking me?
\end{itemize}
