\subsection{Tools}
For bugtracking we are using issues and boards in gitlab, for when we find bugs in either automated tests or by doing user tests. Every bug is tagged as a bug and is sorted in priority by labels. 

For traceability we use the boards tool for issues in gitlab. Each requirement is uploaded as an issue, with a requirement label on it. Test cases are added to the description of the requirement and when the requirement is ready for development it is changed label for  "ready for development". After the requirement is developed it is tested with the test case added in the beginning. 

Microsoft teams is used for all communication within the testing team and for communicating with the rest of the company. The files section are used for storing files that is of importance.
