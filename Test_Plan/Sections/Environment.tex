\subsection{Tools}
For bugtracking we are using issues and boards in gitlab, for when we find bugs in either automated tests or by doing user tests. Every bug is tagged as a bug and is sorted in priority by labels. 

For traceability we use the planner tool integrated in teams. There is a page called testing backlog in the channel Validation where all Test cases are added when it is able to develop them. The testcases are then added to our RTM according to what was described earlier. 

Microsoft teams is also used for all communication within the testing team and for communicating with the rest of the company. The files section are used for storing files that is of importance.
