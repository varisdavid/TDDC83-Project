\section{Change Log}
	\textit{All documents that are to be reviewed or inspected shall have a document change log. This facilitates in tracking changes and verifying that those are approved by someone other than the author. Version Number provides a means to refer to a specific version. Published Date is the date when the certain version is locked. Description of Revision is a brief description of what has been changed/added/removed and, if applicable, which chapter it concerns. Author is responsible for the changes made to the certain version. Approved by refers to who has conducted a review or inspection, thus only applicable for primary number increments (e.g. 2.0, 3.0). See table \ref{tab:changeLog}.}

	\textit{To each revision of a document, an author needs to be chosen among those who have contributed to the changes. This person is responsible for the state of the document and conducting the review process if a new version is to be released. Minor changes to single chapters shall be issued with a decimal increment, for example from 1.1 to 1.2. If the author considers a series of minor changes in total constitute a large difference from the latest reviewed version, the document manager shall be contacted for review or inspection. After such a process, the document is issued as a primary version with a primary number increment, i.e from 1.7 to 2.0.} \\ 
	
	\textit{Each new version of a document shall be included in the change log. At the publishing date it should be added to Teams at applicable location in pdf format. This way each version of the documents are easy to find and locked for changes after approval.}
