\section{Overview}
The second chapter of the document, Overall Description, gives an overview of the functionality of the product.


The third chapter, Requirements Specification, gives a more  detailed description of the system and its features. 

\chapter{Overall Description}
This section will present an overview of the entire system. The system's basic functionality and how it interacts with other systems will be introduced. % The constraints and assumptions for the system will also be presented. 

\section{Product Perspective}
\begin{figure}[htp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{architecture.png}
    \caption{Box and line diagram illustrating layers of the system and its submodules}
    \label{fig: boxAndLineDiag}
\end{figure}
The web-based application aims to aid Region Östergötland's health care staff in overseeing and handling many patients. The system interfaces can be seen in Figure \ref{fig: boxAndLineDiag} and is described further in the Architecture Notebook version 0.5.2. The system components can be described in four layers: GUI, Front end logic, HeartByte Server and EhrScape Server.

The GUI consists of four main modules. The Interface is what the user will interact with and what
will display the web app. From the Interface the user can access the Patient Overview, the Patient Selector and the Patient View. The Interface also allows a user to log in and for admins, to customize the rules applied in the Rule Engine and views of the patients.

The Front End Logic contains the ”middleware” interacting with the HeartByte Server and the GUI
to deliver data to the GUI. The most central module is the Client Data Retriever, which handles calls from Patient Overview and Patient View. 

The HeartByte Server contains the databases specific to the system and the functionality to retrieve
EHRs. The EHR Retriever is the module responsible for loading data from EHRs. 

The EhrScape Server layer is a database stored on an external server, which is accessed using the EhrScape API. 



\section{Product functions} 
This web application aims to aid health care staff in handling many patients and their health data. The system aims to have an overview in which the user will be able to see all patients in their department. These patients can then be sorted and filtered by different criteria, which will aid the user in prioritizing which patients are in most need of care. It will also be possible to customize views with specific patients based on different criteria, such as diagnosis and teams.

The user will also be able to show more detailed information about the individual patients should they choose to click on a patient. In the individual patient view the user will get access to more information than what was available in the overview of all patients. The individual patient may have measured health data, medical information and history, and scheduled appointments which will be displayed in different tabs on the web application. 

In the individual patient view the admin of the system will also be able to set at which values the system shall trigger a change in the patient's priority level. 


\section{User Characteristics}
There are two intended users of the system: users and administrators, as defined in section~\ref{section:def}. The admin shall have access to all the same functionalities as the user, but the user shall not have access to any admin functionality. Some of the customizable elements shall only be customizable by an admin and the admin will also be the one to set the criteria for the different priority levels.


\section{Constraints}
The main constraint for this product concerns confidentiality and security. Since this product is designed to be used by health care providers there are some regulations concerning patient data security, such as "patientdatalagen". These regulations mainly affect patient data confidentiality and what health care staff should have access to what patient information.

\section{Assumptions and dependencies}
An assumption is that the system will be used on computers and tablets with a web browser. Since the system requires the user to be logged in to access any functionality it is also assumed that the user has logged in.

The system needs to interact with other systems to function. OAuth is to be used for authentication and log in functionality. The system will also need to interact with an OpenEHR-database to access and store EHRs. 

%"This subsection of the SRS should list each of the factors that affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These factors are not design constraints on the software but are, rather, any changes to them that can affect the requirements in the SRS. For example, an assumption may be that a specific operating system will be available on the hardware designated for the software product. If, in fact, the operating system is not available, the SRS would then have to change accordingly."

%\section{Apporting of requirements}
%There are some requirements that could be delayed until future versions of the systems if the project is delayed.

\chapter{Specific requirements}
This chapter contains the software requirements and gives a detailed
description of the system and its features. 

\section{Interface requirements}
The main system interface is the user interface. The user interfaces are divided into two subsections: the user view and the admin view. The admin has, as previously mentioned, every functionality the user has. Meanwhile the user lacks som functionality that only an admin has access to. 

\subsection{User interfaces -  User View}
This section describes the user interfaces as the pages/views defined in the document "Hi-Fi" version 2.1 from the prototype team.

\subsubsection{Login page}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{login.png}
    \caption{Login page}
    \label{fig: login}
\end{figure}

First page shown when signing in to the system. Start by selecting the operation and then log in with the employment-ID or username and then enter a password. See Figure \ref{fig: login}. Successful login with OAuth leads to the “Mina Patienter” page. 

\subsubsection{Patient view}
The individual patient view is divided into several tabs: "Mätvärden", "Översikt", "Läkmedelslista" and  "Kalender". The following sections are based on these tabs. 

\subsubsection{"Mätvärden"}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{meas.png}
    \caption{Measurements}
    \label{fig: meas}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{measweight.png}
    \caption{Measurements Weight}
    \label{fig: measweight}
\end{figure}
All the current measurements for the specific patient are displayed in graphs. Warning symbols if something needs to be handled. See Figure \ref{fig: meas}.
The graphs in the first page of the measurement are displayed with only a target range. When entering a specific measurement, see Figure \ref{fig: measweight}, intervals are also shown for what triggers yellow and red notifications. This is shown by default, but the user can choose to not display the intervals by clicking the check box “Visa intervall”. The "Ändra intervall"-button in Figure \ref{fig: measweight} is not visible for regular users.

\clearpage

\subsubsection{"Översikt"}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{patoverview.png}
    \caption{Patient overview}
    \label{fig: patoverview}
\end{figure}
Information about the specific patient with contact information and emergency contact. Shows current diagnoses, current medication intake, average of current measurement values, previous diagnoses and caregivers and staff who handle the patient. Picture of the specific patient.

The tables length is adapted to the number of diagnoses, medications, measurements, responsible staff members etc. 

Table of “tidigare sjukdomar” is shown with a maximum of 4 rows with the see more text included. When pressing see more, the table expands in length and shows the rest of the information.


\clearpage

\subsubsection{"Läkemedelslista"}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{medications.png}
    \caption{Medications list}
    \label{fig: medications}
\end{figure}
Table of medicines that shows current/relevant medication intake for a specific patient and a table of medicines that a specific patient can take if necessary.

\clearpage

\subsubsection{"Kalender"}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{patcalendar.png}
    \caption{Patient Calendar}
    \label{fig: patcalendar}
\end{figure}

Displays a calendar view over a month. When interacting with a specific day in the calendar the booked activities are displayed in a view in a table next to it. All the upcoming activities are also shown in the table that you can scroll. By default, the current day is displayed. Ability to choose a day view or a view with a list of all the upcoming activities (this should be the default view). The tables are possible to expand. Ability to add activities into the calendar, this function is not necessary to build, can only show the button.


\subsubsection{Overview}
The overview of patients is also divided into several tabs: "Mina Patienter", "Alla Patienter", "Notislogg" and "Kalender". The following sections are based on these tabs. 

\subsubsection{"Mina Patienter"}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{mypat.png}
    \caption{My Patients}
    \label{fig: mypat}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{mypatfilter.png}
    \caption{My Patients Filter}
    \label{fig: mypatfilter}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{createnewview.png}
    \caption{Create new view}
    \label{fig: createnewview}
\end{figure}

Shows table of all patients in the system connected to the department you are logged in to. See Figure \ref{fig: mypat}. Ability to search for specific patients and filter and sort the list. See Figure \ref{fig: mypatfilter} for filter function. The sort functions are placed on each heading in the table. Doctors icons in the table show who is handling the notification.

Ability to add new views visible only to the currently logged in user, can add up to 7 views, so there will be 4 buttons on top (including the “lägg till ny vy” button) and 4 buttons under when adding more. Also ability to remove these filters by clicking on “X”. See Figure \ref{fig: createnewview}

The gear icon in the filter/search box is not visible for users.


\clearpage

\subsubsection{"Alla Patienter"}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{allpat.png}
    \caption{All Patients}
    \label{fig: allpat}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{allpatdiabetes.png}
    \caption{All Patients Specific View}
    \label{fig: allpatdiabetes}
\end{figure}
Can show all the patients in the system. Patients are shown in the table when searched for. The information of patients the user does not have access to that can be shown is the name, social security number and level of alertness. The rest of the information of the patients to whom the user does not have access shall be blurred, until the user has asked for permission to access said information. 

\clearpage

\subsubsection{"Notislogg"}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{notifications.png}
    \caption{Notifications}
    \label{fig: notifications}
\end{figure}
All the activities that happen are gathered in this notification log with a prioritization of how important the notification is to be handled. For example, if a measured value is taken with a large deviation from the average value, this should indicate a high prioritized notification.
Same sorting and search box as in “Mina patienter” and “Alla patienter”.


\subsubsection{"Kalender"}
The difference between this calendar and the calendar under the patient specific view, see Figure \ref{fig: patcalendar}, is that the calendar for the logged-in staff is displayed here. Therefore, the activities displayed in the patient specific calendar will differ from those activities that will appear in this calendar. Here activities will be about booked meetings with patients. 

\subsection{User interfaces -  Admin View}
\label{section: admin}
This section describes the admin views as defined in the document "Hi-Fi" version 2.1 from the prototype team. As the admin has the same functionality as the user only the functionality the user does not have access to but the admin does is described in this section. The section is divided into different subsections based on the system's different pages.

\subsubsection{"Översikt"}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{mypatsettings.png}
    \caption{My Patients Settings}
    \label{fig: mypatsettings}
\end{figure}

The gear icon in the filter/search box is only visible for admins and leads to a pop-up window of display settings "Översiktsinställningar" where the admin can determine which columns shall be visible in the dashboard, see Figure \ref{fig: mypatsettings}.

\subsubsection{"Patient"}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{patadmin.png}
    \caption{Patient - Admin}
    \label{fig: patadmin}
\end{figure}

Page only visible for admins. See Figure \ref{fig: patadmin}.

"Inställningar Prioriteringar Mätvärden"
Set the settings for intervals on the patient measurements. For changing the intervals you press “Ändra intervall” and are directed to the measurement page where you can change the interval and seeing the graph and measurements at the same time. The the user presses “Ändra intervall” once on admin page to see the setting in measurement.

"Aktivitetslogg"
Shows all the activity that happens on a patient specific page. All activities must be logged for the patient's integrity. The admin shall be able to sort and filter activity log in order to find specific logs.

\subsubsection{"Mätvärden"}
In the page "Mätvärden" only admins have a visible  “Ändra intervall”-button. When interacting with the button, the interval setting is displayed next to the graph. See Figure \ref{fig: measweight}.
