\chapter{Introduction}
This chapter presents the purpose, scope, definitions, references and an overview of the software requirements specification (SRS). 

\section{Purpose}
The purpose of the SRS is to document and present a detailed and structured description of HeartByte's application, a patient management system, developed as requested by Region Östergötland (RÖ). The SRS will describe the purpose and features of the system, the system constraints, interfaces of the system as well as interactions with external applications. The SRS is intended to be used by HeartByte’s stakeholders in their approval process. Furthermore, the purpose of the SRS is to be a reference and/or structural framework for HeartByte designers, developers, testers and managers ensuring a uniform view of the product to be developed. Moreover, the SRS ensures the traceability of requirements.

\section{Scope}
HeartByte's product is a web-based application developed to aid RÖ's health care staff in overseeing and handling many patients. The aim of the system is to make it easier for the health care staff to oversee many patients' measured health data and prioritize which patients are in most need of care. The system will provide customizable overviews and prioritization-levels, interactive health data visualization, a well thought out notification system and helpful sorting and filtering functions to facilitate in prioritization of patients. In addition to a better overview of all patients, the system will provide a more detailed overview of individual patients' health situation, including for instance current medication, diagnosis and measured health data.

\section{Overview}
The SRS is constructed according to IEEE Std 830-1998 \cite{ieeesrsrec} and contains 3 chapters. The first chapter describes the intended use of the SRS and provides a brief description of HeartByte’s application and the application’s value for the user. Furthermore, the first chapter also contains a list of definitions, acronyms and abbreviations to facilitate in reading the SRS. In addition, references are also provided in the first chapter. In the second chapter an overall description of the application is presented which includes the perspectives and functions of the product as well as user characteristics, constraints and assumptions and dependencies. The third and final chapter presents a detailed description of the application including interface requirements, functional and performance requirements, software system attributes and other requirements. 

\chapter{Overall Description}
In this chapter an overview of the entire system is presented. The system's perspective and its basic functionality as well as how it interacts with other systems will be introduced. Furthermore, user characteristics, constraints, assumptions and dependencies will also be described.

\section{Product Perspective}
HeartByte’s system is a web-based application developed with the intention to aid RÖ’s health care staff in monitoring the health of many patients enrolled in their self-monitoring program. The system is OS independent and utilizes a scalable user interface that works seamlessly across a wide range of screen sizes. Consequently, HeartByte’s system is not limited to stationary desktop computers used in the workplace, it can also be used with mobile devices when visiting patients in their homes. The patients being self-monitored have chronic illness such as diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or consist of frail older adults susceptible to disease or to other infirmity. In HeartByte’s system the patients under care are clearly organized after healthcare centers within RÖ and their subunits for efficient navigation. Furthermore, the system provides the possibility to create customized views so that only the most important information is presented in a particular view for specific healthcare center or subunit within RÖ. The patients report their health data using compatible patient monitoring devices and then the data is presented in HeartByte’s system for the health care staff to assess. The health data is presented in an unambiguous way and in addition effectively visualized in interactive graphs to further aid the health care staff in their evaluation of patients. HeartByte’s system allows for easy and practical filtering and sorting of patients as well as effective search capabilities which makes it uncomplicated to navigated between patients and patient categories. Prioritization levels can be set to alert health care staff to take appropriate actions when a patient exceed the boundaries for a health parameter. Patient alerts and notification have been thoughtfully implemented in HeartByte’s system to minimize potential alert fatigue faced by the health care staff when monitoring many patients. In order to ensure patient safety and to follow the Swedish Patient Data Act \cite{patientdatalag}, HeartByte’s system logs user activity and patient accesses.  

\subsection{System interfaces}
The architecture of HeartByte’s system is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig: boxAndLineDiag} and is further described in the Architecture Notebook \cite{architecture}. The system consists of the following four layers: graphical user interface (GUI), Front-end logic, HeartByte Server and EhrScape Server. The flow of the data is indicated by the direction of the arrows. 

\subsubsection{GUI Layer}
The GUI is made up of four modules and handles what will be displayed and what the user will interact with in the web application. From the Interface the user can access the Patient Overview which presents an overview of patients. Through the Patient Selector, specific patients can be selected to be viewed in the Patient View. Furthermore, the Interface module allows a user to log in, and for an admin to customize the rules applied in the Rule Engine through the Rule Customizer as well as to customize views via the View Customizer.

\subsubsection{Front End Logic Layer}
The Front-end Logic contains the “middleware” which interacts with the HeartByte Server and the GUI to deliver data to the GUI. The Client Data Retriever module handles requests from Patient Overview regarding group of patients and the Patient View processes requests for specific patients. The Rule Engine classifies how critical the patient’s health status is. The Filtration module handles filtration of data. Authentication requests are processed by the Authentication module, and customization calls are handled by the customizer modules. The GUI and Front-end Logic layer together constitutes the client part of HeartByte’s system.

\subsubsection{HeartByte Server Layer}
The HeartByte Server includes the databases specific to the system and the functionality to retrieve EHRs. Loading and storing data from/to the Personnel Database (containing personnel data) and Customization Database (containing views for a specific health care center or subunit within RÖ) is made possible by the System Database Management. Upon requests the EHR Retriever module loads data from EHRs by calling the EHrScape Server. When the EHR Retriever is called it will also check the credentials of the user behind the request. The Access Log database stores patient accesses by users.

\subsubsection{EhrScape Server Layer}
The EhrScape Server layer is a database stored on an external server and accessed using the EhrScape API. Archetype Query Language and its Representational State Transfer API is used to query the API.

    \label{fig: boxAndLineDiag}
\end{figure}

\section{Product functions} 
HeartByte’s web application provides an overview of patients self-monitoring their health in which the user of the application will be able to clearly see and efficiently manage all patients in their healthcare center or subunit within RÖ. Patients can be sorted and filtered by different criteria, which will aid the user in the navigation between patients. Health prioritization levels set by a specific healthcare center or subunit will effectively present the patients in most need of care for the health care staff, as well as alert the staff when appropriate actions need to be taken. Admins can set at which values the system will trigger a change in the patient’s priority level. Views in the application can be customized based on for instance diagnosis and team. When a specific patient is accessed the user is presented with detailed information about the patient in question. Detailed information includes measured health data, current medication, contact information, medical information, activity history, scheduled appointments and so on. Furthermore, for each patient the measured health data is presented with interactive graphs of the measured health data to aid the health care staff in their assessment and understanding of a patient’s health situation. 
\newline
\newline
Some significant functions included in HeartByte’s system are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig: useCaseDiag}. The use case diagram is not a complete representation of all functions provided by HeartByte’s system but it rather represents a general overview of significant functions. The use case diagram is further described in the Architecture Notebook \cite{architecture}.

Listed below as user stories are the significant functions of HeartByte’s web application:
\newline
\newline
\textbf{U1:} As a health care worker, I want to see an clear overview of many patients so that I can manage many patients under care.
\newline
\newline
\textbf{U2:} As a health care worker, I want to be able to sort patients by ‘Namn’, ‘Personnummer’, ‘Prioritet’, ‘Diagnos’ and ‘Senast Uppdaterad’ so that I can efficiently navigate through many patients.
\newline
\newline
\textbf{U3:} As a health care worker, I want to be able to filter patients by ‘Ålder’, ‘Prioritering’, ‘Verksamhet’, ‘Team’, ‘Avdelning’ and ‘Diagnos’ so that I can quickly find patients.
\newline
\newline

    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{useCase.png}
    \caption{Use case diagram of significant functions}
    \label{fig: useCaseDiag}
\end{figure}

\section{User Characteristics}
The users of HeartByte’s system are either administrators or users, as defined in section~\ref{section:def}. Administrators are users with extended system capabilities. Administrators can set health prioritization rules for patients and customize views according to the guidelines set by a health care center or subunit within RÖ. All users of HeartByte’s system are expected to have a certain level of medical competence to use the system as intended, that is to provide safe and proper care for patients enrolled in RÖ’s self-monitoring program.


\section{Constraints}
The main constraints for HeartByte’s system concerns  confidentiality and security. Since the application process personal data within health and medical care, the system is required to follow the rules governing the processing of such data which can be found in the Swedish Patient Data Act \cite{patientdatalag}. These rules are mainly about patient data confidentiality and who may access patient information.

\section{Assumptions and dependencies}
HeartByte’s application is assumed to be used on desktop computers and tablets, independent of OS, with a web browser and with hardware capable enough of running the application. Furthermore, a stable internet connection is assumed to run the application. To use HeartByte’s system it is also assumed that the user has logged into the system. In addition, it is assumed that required integration of standards, licenses, API:s, databases, components, libraries and frameworks with HeartByte’s application work correctly in order to use the application.
\newline
\newline
The health management of patients with HeartByte’s application is dependent on data submitted using compatible health monitoring devices by patients enrolled in RÖ’s self-monitoring program. HearByte’s application is dependent on internet access to query the database. Moreover, HeartByte’s system is dependent on OAuth for authentication and log in functionality. The system is also dependent on the OpenEHR-database to access and store EHRs.

%"This subsection of the SRS should list each of the factors that affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These factors are not design constraints on the software but are, rather, any changes to them that can affect the requirements in the SRS. For example, an assumption may be that a specific operating system will be available on the hardware designated for the software product. If, in fact, the operating system is not available, the SRS would then have to change accordingly."

%\section{Apporting of requirements}
%There are some requirements that could be delayed until future versions of the systems if the project is delayed.

\chapter{Specific requirements}
This chapter contains the software requirements and gives a detailed
description of the system and its features. 

\section{Interface requirements}
The main system interface is the user interface. The user interfaces are divided into two subsections: the user view and the admin view. The admin has, as previously mentioned, every functionality the user has. Meanwhile the user lacks som functionality that only an admin has access to. 

\subsection{User interfaces -  User View}
This section describes the user interfaces as the pages/views defined in the "Hi-Fi 2.1" document \cite{prototype}.

\subsubsection{Login page}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{login.png}
    \caption{Login page}
    \label{fig: login}
\end{figure}

First page shown when signing in to the system. Start by selecting the operation and then log in with the employment-ID or username and then enter a password. See Figure \ref{fig: login}. Successful login with OAuth leads to the “Mina Patienter” page. 

\subsubsection{Patient view}
The individual patient view is divided into several tabs: "Mätvärden", "Översikt", "Läkmedelslista" and  "Kalender". The following sections are based on these tabs. 

\subsubsection{"Mätvärden"}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{meas.png}
    \caption{Measurements}
    \label{fig: meas}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{measweight.png}
    \caption{Measurements Weight}
    \label{fig: measweight}
\end{figure}
All the current measurements for the specific patient are displayed in graphs. Warning symbols if something needs to be handled. See Figure \ref{fig: meas}.
The graphs in the first page of the measurement are displayed with only a target range. When entering a specific measurement, see Figure \ref{fig: measweight}, intervals are also shown for what triggers yellow and red notifications. This is shown by default, but the user can choose to not display the intervals by clicking the check box “Visa intervall”. The "Ändra intervall"-button in Figure \ref{fig: measweight} is not visible for regular users.

\clearpage

\subsubsection{"Översikt"}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{patoverview.png}
    \caption{Patient overview}
    \label{fig: patoverview}
\end{figure}
Information about the specific patient with contact information and emergency contact. Shows current diagnoses, current medication intake, average of current measurement values, previous diagnoses and caregivers and staff who handle the patient. Picture of the specific patient.

The tables length is adapted to the number of diagnoses, medications, measurements, responsible staff members etc. 

Table of “tidigare sjukdomar” is shown with a maximum of 4 rows with the see more text included. When pressing see more, the table expands in length and shows the rest of the information.


\clearpage

\subsubsection{"Läkemedelslista"}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{medications.png}
    \caption{Medications list}
    \label{fig: medications}
\end{figure}
Table of medicines that shows current/relevant medication intake for a specific patient and a table of medicines that a specific patient can take if necessary.

\clearpage

\subsubsection{"Kalender"}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{patcalendar.png}
    \caption{Patient Calendar}
    \label{fig: patcalendar}
\end{figure}

Displays a calendar view over a month. When interacting with a specific day in the calendar the booked activities are displayed in a view in a table next to it. All the upcoming activities are also shown in the table that you can scroll. By default, the current day is displayed. Ability to choose a day view or a view with a list of all the upcoming activities (this should be the default view). The tables are possible to expand. Ability to add activities into the calendar, this function is not necessary to build, can only show the button.


\subsubsection{Overview}
The overview of patients is also divided into several tabs: "Mina Patienter", "Alla Patienter", "Notislogg" and "Kalender". The following sections are based on these tabs. 

\subsubsection{"Mina Patienter"}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{mypat.png}
    \caption{My Patients}
    \label{fig: mypat}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{mypatfilter.png}
    \caption{My Patients Filter}
    \label{fig: mypatfilter}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{createnewview.png}
    \caption{Create new view}
    \label{fig: createnewview}
\end{figure}

Shows table of all patients in the system connected to the department you are logged in to. See Figure \ref{fig: mypat}. Ability to search for specific patients and filter and sort the list. See Figure \ref{fig: mypatfilter} for filter function. The sort functions are placed on each heading in the table. Doctors icons in the table show who is handling the notification.

Ability to add new views visible only to the currently logged in user, can add up to 7 views, so there will be 4 buttons on top (including the “lägg till ny vy” button) and 4 buttons under when adding more. Also ability to remove these filters by clicking on “X”. See Figure \ref{fig: createnewview}

The gear icon in the filter/search box is not visible for users.


\clearpage

\subsubsection{"Alla Patienter"}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{allpat.png}
    \caption{All Patients}
    \label{fig: allpat}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{allpatdiabetes.png}
    \caption{All Patients Specific View}
    \label{fig: allpatdiabetes}
\end{figure}
Can show all the patients in the system. Patients are shown in the table when searched for. The information of patients the user does not have access to that can be shown is the name, social security number and level of alertness. The rest of the information of the patients to whom the user does not have access shall be blurred, until the user has asked for permission to access said information. 

\clearpage

\subsubsection{"Notislogg"}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{notifications.png}
    \caption{Notifications}
    \label{fig: notifications}
\end{figure}
All the activities that happen are gathered in this notification log with a prioritization of how important the notification is to be handled. For example, if a measured value is taken with a large deviation from the average value, this should indicate a high prioritized notification.
Same sorting and search box as in “Mina patienter” and “Alla patienter”.


\subsubsection{"Kalender"}
The difference between this calendar and the calendar under the patient specific view, see Figure \ref{fig: patcalendar}, is that the calendar for the logged-in staff is displayed here. Therefore, the activities displayed in the patient specific calendar will differ from those activities that will appear in this calendar. Here activities will be about booked meetings with patients. 

\subsection{User interfaces -  Admin View}
\label{section: admin}
This section describes the admin views as defined in the "Hi-Fi" document \cite{prototype}. As the admin has the same functionality as the user only the functionality the user does not have access to but the admin does is described in this section. The section is divided into different subsections based on the system's different pages.

\subsubsection{"Översikt"}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{mypatsettings.png}
    \caption{My Patients Settings}
    \label{fig: mypatsettings}
\end{figure}

The gear icon in the filter/search box is only visible for admins and leads to a pop-up window of display settings "Översiktsinställningar" where the admin can determine which columns shall be visible in the dashboard, see Figure \ref{fig: mypatsettings}.

\subsubsection{"Patient"}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{patadmin.png}
    \caption{Patient - Admin}
    \label{fig: patadmin}
\end{figure}

Page only visible for admins. See Figure \ref{fig: patadmin}.

"Inställningar Prioriteringar Mätvärden"
Set the settings for intervals on the patient measurements. For changing the intervals you press “Ändra intervall” and are directed to the measurement page where you can change the interval and seeing the graph and measurements at the same time. The the user presses “Ändra intervall” once on admin page to see the setting in measurement.

"Aktivitetslogg"
Shows all the activity that happens on a patient specific page. All activities must be logged for the patient's integrity. The admin shall be able to sort and filter activity log in order to find specific logs.

\subsubsection{"Mätvärden"}
In the page "Mätvärden" only admins have a visible  “Ändra intervall”-button. When interacting with the button, the interval setting is displayed next to the graph. See Figure \ref{fig: measweight}.
